//: # Planning Exercise
/*:
 Now we need to *make a plan* for how to teach the computer to decode the more interesting bitmap images.
 
 As humans, we already know how to do this.
 
 So if you haven't yet, decode this image on paper:
 
 ![encoding](encoding.png "png")
 
 The encoded bitmap below looks like a Christmas tree.*
 
 \*At least it's supposed to; my bitmap art skills are perhaps an area for improvement! *â€“Mr. Gordon*
 
 Now: think carefully about how you actually performed the decoding.
 
 What decisions did you make?
 
 List the decisions you made in as much detail as possible.
 
 */

// Here's my list of points describing how I decoded the image...
// 1. know what image do i want
// 2.draw it on the paper, and find the size of it
// 3.count how many white and black squares in the image
// 4.put it in the number
// 5.write it down, and make sure the sum of every line are same
// etc. (add more points as needed)

/*:
 Now, **remember to commit and push your work**.
